## What I'm Pleased With

To my knowledge I've completed the minimum requirements of the task. The code performs the pathfinding algorithim and returns the shortest distance between the two points.
The unit tests I've added seem to suggest it's working.

## What I Would Have Done With More Time
- Done more testing for different board sizes
- Done more testing for different board shapes (e.g. not square)
- Done more testing for edge cases (such as when it's on the extremities of the map)
- Not just return the shortest distance, return the coordinates of the route
- Use that information to add a visual element so you can see the shortest route 
- Optimized the code for larger boards, I think some of my code could be more efficient. For instance the check to see if it appears in the array is fine with such a small board but for huge boards this calculation could take a while. After a quick google search it recommends using a Set to do this but I didn't think of that at the time.
